        <h2>What is Gestalt?</h2>
            <cite>by Jeannine | February 18, 2020</cite>

                    <p> I'm a student at Kenzie Academy, enrolled in the UIE-4 Cohort.
                    I'm a visual artist, mom and UX Engineer.
                    I've always felt like I could learn anything and that's left me with a lot of hobbies. 
                    Painting, sculpting, writing, fiber arts and an extensive cooking repertoire 
                    means I never run short of things to do, just time to do them in.
                    Being a mom has made time-management into an olympic sport, but I'd never have 
                    it any other way. My two daughters are a driving force for me, 
                    it is so important for me to show them that they can do 
                    anything that speaks to them. I live to be inspired and to create 
                    designs that are alive with that inspiration. All of this is translated into my designs 
                    and the work that I do, so that I can create the very best I'm capable of.
