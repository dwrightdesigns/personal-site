            <p>Hey there, I'm Jeannine!
                I'm a student at Kenzie Academy, enrolled in the UIE-4 Cohort.
                 I'm a visual artist, mom and UX Engineer.
                 I've always felt like I could learn anything and that's left me with a lot of hobbies. 
                 Painting, sculpting, writing, fiber arts and an extensive cooking repertoire 
                 means I never run short of things to do, just time to do them in. 
                 Being a mom has made me a time-management wizard and I'd never have 
                 it any other way. My two daughters are a driving force for me, 
                 it is so important for me to show them that they can do 
                 anything that speaks to them. I live to be inspired and to create 
                 designs with passion and expertise. All of this is translated into my designs 
                 and the work that I do, so that I can create the very best I'm capable of.</p>
