                I'm a student at Kenzie Academy, enrolled in the UIE-4 Cohort.
                 I'm a visual artist, mom and UX Engineer.
                 I've always felt like I could learn anything and that's left me with a lot of hobbies. 
                 Painting, sculpting, writing, fiber arts and an extensive cooking repertoire 
                 means I never run short of things to do, just time to do them in. 
                 Being a mom has made time-management into an olympic sport, but I'd never have 
                 it any other way. My two daughters are a driving force for me, 
                 it is so important for me to show them that they can do 
                 anything that speaks to them. I live to be inspired and to create 
                 designs that are alive with that inspiration. All of this is translated into my designs 
                 and the work that I do, so that I can create the very best I'm capable of.

                        EventFull is a capstone project designed to compete with Eventbrite and other event 
                        management apps. This project was developed with a team of four designers and features
                        a range of tools for users who wish to plan or attend events and find others who are 
                        interested in the same types of activities. Allowing users to communicate with event
                        planning teams and atendees sets EventFull apart from the competition.
