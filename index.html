        <p>Hey there, I'm Jeannine!
             I'm a student at Kenzie Academy, enrolled in the UIE-4 Cohort.
              I'm a visual artist, mom and UX Engineer. 
              My experience is varied from customer service and retail to 
              owning my own business and designing websites for local 
              businesses using Wordpress and Wix. The latter left me with a desire to learn more 
              about building websites and developing apps that could help people connect. <br> <br>
              I've always felt like I could learn anything worth doing and that's left me with a lot of hobbies. 
              Painting, sculpting, writing, fiber arts and an extensive cooking repertoire 
              means I never run short of things to do, just time to do them in. 
              Being a mom puts even more pressure on my time, but I'd never have 
              it any other way. My two daughters are a driving force for me, 
              it is so important for me to show them that they can do 
              anything that speaks to them. I live to be inspired and to create 
              designs with passion and expertise. All of this is translated into my designs 
              and the work that I do, so that I can create the very best I'm capable of.</p>
